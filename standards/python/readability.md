## 3. Writing Readable Code

### 3.1 Comments
- **Block Comments**: Use block comments to explain code. Each line starts with `#` and a space.
- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly. Place them at least two spaces from the statement.
- **Documentation Strings (Docstrings)**: Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.

### 3.2 Descriptive Naming
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
